# Devel::PreProcessor -- 2003.1128

  Name            DSLIP  Description
  --------------  -----  ---------------------------------------------
  Devel::
  ::PreProcessor  rdpfp  Module inlining and other Perl source manipulations

This package processes Perl source files and outputs a modified
version acording to several user-setable options, as follows:

If the Includes flag is activated, Devel::PreProcessor will attempt
to replace C<use> and C<require> statements with inline declarations
containg the source of the relevant library found in the current
@INC. The resulting script should operate identically and no longer
be dependant on external libraries, but note that libraries inlined
with Includes may not be appropriate on another system, ex, if
Config is inlined, the script may fail if run on a platform other
than that on which it was built.

If the StripPods flag is activated, Devel::PreProcessor will not
include POD documentatation from the source files.

If the Conditionals flag is activated, Devel::PreProcessor will
utilize a simple conditional inclusion scheme. Lines begining with
"#__CONDITIONAL__ if ..." will have the remainder of the line
evaluated as a Perl expression; unless the result is true, the
following lines will be omitted until a line containing "#__CONDITIONAL__
endif"

This module has been tested in several environments and no major
problems have been discovered, but those tests have been somewhat
limited and you are advised to try it in your environment to confirm
it works as expected.

You should be able to install this module using the CPAN shell
interface:
